##Introduction
Kanye West is one of the most influential entertainers of the past decade. His creative exploits in music production have overflowed into multiple facets of pop culture - including fashion, social media influence, and publicity stunts. The aggregation of his attention-grabbing work coalesces into an exceptional body of "celebrity engineering" work. Before self-proclaimed deity comparisons fueled by the visibility of celebrity life, "Yeezus" was the pink-poloed, backpack-strapped producer creating platforms for others to  communicate to the public through. So... since 'Ye has picked up the mic, what has he said? Can we tease out the crucial moments in his evolution from "man" to "god" through the emotional sentiment of his lyrics?

##Discography Analysis
One of the first apparent things is that "god" is the 10th most frequently used unique word across all of Kanye's albums. Please consider that "The College Dropout" references "god" in a a much different way than later albums such as "Yeezus". On "I Am a God" Kayne attempts to rectify some humility following self-comparison to the lord on the hook: "I am a god / Even though I am a man of God / My whole life in the hand of God". The size of the each text fragment is scaled to the frequency of use.
