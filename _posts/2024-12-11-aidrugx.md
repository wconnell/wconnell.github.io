title:  "A semantic map of NeurIPS 24' Workshop on AI for New Drug Modalities"
categories: [ai,biology,research]
--- 
I built a semantic map that organizes research papers by analyzing their titles, abstracts, and keywords. This visualization highlights thematic clusters, hopefully making it easier to explore related research between domains. The themes that relate these papers are diverse, including biology, chemistry, problem domain or technical method.

To explore the papers interactively, select a paper that interests you and discover how it connects to others sharing similar themes within its cluster. Below is also a a table detailing all the papers, organized by cluster.

### Methods
- Access the AIDrugX Workshop OpenReview portal [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/AIDrugX#tab-accept-spotlight)
- Semantic embeddings were generated using Sentence-BERT, leveraging paper titles, abstracts, and keywords
- PCA was applied to reduce dimensionality for visualization
- Use the 'Semantic Clusters' toggle to highlight cluster colors in the visualization
- apers are organized by cluster in the table below for easier navigation
