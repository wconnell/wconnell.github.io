I built a semantic map that organizes research papers by analyzing their titles, abstracts, and keywords. This visualization highlights thematic clusters, hopefully making it easier to explore related research between domains. The themes that relate these papers are diverse, including biology, chemistry, problem domain or technical method.

To explore the papers interactively, select a paper that interests you and discover how it connects to others sharing similar themes within its cluster (toggle 'Semantic Clusters'). Below is also a a table detailing all the papers, organized by cluster.

### Methods
- Data pulled from the AIDrugX Workshop OpenReview portal [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/AIDrugX#tab-accept-spotlight)
- Find the workshop website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/newmodality-aidrug)
- Semantic embeddings were generated using Sentence-BERT, using paper titles, abstracts, and keywords
- PCA was applied to reduce dimensionality for visualization
