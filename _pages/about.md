I earned my PhD from the UCSF Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics Department, where I was a part of the [Keiser Lab](https://www.keiserlab.org/). My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and biology. For a detailed overview of my academic and professional journey, please refer to [my CV](../docs/cv.pdf). 

**Currently, I am open to new opportunities**. Feel free to reach out on X or via email (see footer). I am always open to academic collaboration opportunities and professional consultations.
