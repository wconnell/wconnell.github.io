I am a Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics doctoral student in the [Keiser Lab](https://www.keiserlab.org/) at UCSF. I have an undergraduate research background in gene therapy for blood disease, and I am currently interested in applying computational methods to small molecule experimental interrogations. Please feel free to reach out.
