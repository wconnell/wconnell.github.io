#### Genome-Wide Association Study of Ustekinumab Response in Psoriasis

2022 &#124; *Frontiers in Immunology* &#124; **Connell W.T.**, Hong J., Liao W. &#124; [Article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.815121/full){:target="_blank"}

Heterogeneous genetic and environmental factors contribute to the psoriasis phenotype, resulting in a wide range of patient response to targeted therapies. Here, we investigate genetic factors associated with response to the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab in psoriasis. Through GWAS, we identified a novel SNP that is potentially associated with response to ustekinumab in psoriasis.

#### Nurturing diversity and inclusion in AI in Biomedicine through a virtual summer program for high school students

2022 &#124; *PLOS Computational Biology* &#124; Oskotsky T., Bajaj R., Burchard J., Cavazos T., Chen I., **Connell W.T.**, Eaneff S., Grant T., Kanungo I., Lindquist K., Meyers-Turnbull D., Naing Z.Z.C., Tang A., Vora B., Wang J., Karim I., Swadling C., Yang J., AI4ALL Student Cohort 2020, Lindstaet B., Sirota M. &#124; [Article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009719){:target="_blank"}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the power to improve our lives through a wide variety of applications, many of which fall into the healthcare space; however, a lack of diversity is limiting how broadly AI can impact people. This work can guide AI training programs aspiring to engage and educate students entirely online, and motivate people in AI to strive towards increasing diversity and inclusion in this field.
